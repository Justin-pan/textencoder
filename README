This is a program that I wrote for an assignment in school.

I thought the idea was actually really cool so I decided to upload it to github, and actually clean it up and eventually continue to develop the program.

The program right now is pretty bare bones, right now all it does is translate text encoded in morse, baudot code, and utf-32 to any of those encodings.
